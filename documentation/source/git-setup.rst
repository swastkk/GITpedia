GIT setup
======
To use Git on the command line, you will need to download, install, and configure Git on your computer. You can also install GitHub CLI to use GitHub from the command line. For more information, see `About GitHub CLI <https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli>`_

If you want to work with Git locally, but do not want to use the command line, you can instead download and install the `GitHub Desktop <https://desktop.github.com/>`_ client. For more information, see "Installing and configuring GitHub Desktop."

If you do not need to work with files locally, GitHub lets you complete many Git-related actions directly in the browser, including:


:: 

  - Creating a repository
  - Forking a repository
  - Managing files
  - Being social
